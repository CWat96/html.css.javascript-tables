# HTML Table Elements

* **Purpose** - To gain familiarity with HTML Table Elements




## Objective
* For this assignment, learners should create an HTML file with a table element that includes a caption element and several rows and cells. The table should contain the following data:

| Name         | Power                                  | Alter Ego    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|--------------|
| Superman     | Super Strength, Flight, Laser Vision   | Clark Kent   |
| Wonder Woman | Super Strength, Flight, Healing Factor | Diana Prince |
| Iron Man     | Super Strength, Flight, Laser Beams    | Tony Stark   |

* In addition to the table, learners should also create a form element that includes a text input, a select dropdown, and a submit button.
  * The form should be set up to submit the data to a server, but the actual submission does not need to be implemented.
* The learners should use the `table`, `caption`, `tr`, `th`, and `td` tags to create the table and form elements, and use appropriate attributes to style and organize the elements as needed.
